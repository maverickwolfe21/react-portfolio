# Portfolio-React
WebDevelopment portfolio made with React


## Description:
This project is a portfolio of my Web Development projects and showcases my skills as a developer. It uses React as the framework and Material UI for the component library and UI design. 
This is a single page website, that has a NavBar and Footer, with responsive components loading in the center. 

It includes an about me section. A resume section with a downloadable PDF. A contact me section that includes a form that can be sumbitted with a name, email and comments. The contact section also includes some functionality that checks the state to ensure a correct name and email were entered. It finally includes a portfolio with links to several of my projects GitHubs and live applications. 

This project is a exercise in using React to create a library of my personal projects in web development.
